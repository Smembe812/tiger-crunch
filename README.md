Mono repo housing `auth-server`, `user-service` and `clients-service` apps/modules for tiger-crunch lab.

The main goal is to develop a `server-> client-> end_user` setup for future projects. Federated apps/services supported by custom SSO should stem from this tiger-crunch lab.

Front-end client to move to their own repo.
